TM Style Switcher is a WordPress plugin, which allows users to save their theme settings as skins, switch between them in any moment and even transfer the basic settings to other WordPress themes.

== Description ==

Being extremely intuitive it allows for creating themes with multiple appearance variations, and is, therefore, highly beneficial for web developers.

= Features and settings =

TM Style Switcher operates with settings of WordPress Live Customizer, that’s why it is compatible with just any contemporary theme.

To start working with the plugin go to the Live Customizer in the admin panel of your WordPress website and find the Export/Import tab. Here you will find the following options:

* Export – generates and downloads a .JSON file with your current theme settings;
* Import – uploads previously saved theme settings;
* Restore Settings – restores the default settings that were active before the installation of the plugin.

= Options for developers =

Using style presets, you can implement your own skin switcher and apply custom preview images to skins (see the documentation for more details).

== Installation ==

1. Upload "Cherry Popups" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
